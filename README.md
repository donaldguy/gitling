# Gitling: **git** for **l**earn**ing**(s)

## Quick Start (Incredibly WIP)

```shell
git clone git@github.com:donaldguy/gitling.git
npm install
npm install -g parcel-bundler
parcel index.html
```

## What?

Aspirationally: `gitling` is a bi-directional knowledge server for software teams. 

Mechanically: Gitling is a self-contained daemon which serves a realtime-editable ~wiki to and from the Markdown content of one or more git repos.

### Foundational Goals:

- Be the âœ¨bestâœ¨ tool for a team of people to read, write, and update ***non-autogenerated*** "software documentation": onboarding, design, process, runbooks, FAQs, etc.
- Never demand it be the only tool for any-of-the-above. Let people use their `less`s, `vim`s, `code`s, GitHub edit buttons or IDEs as befits their workflow
- Be a viable tool for on-the-fly capture for e.g. incident management, work journaling, meeting notes, etc.
- Support commit-to-trunk and commit-to-PR (for at least GitHub and VSTS, ideally also GitLab, Bitbucket, Phabricator, Gerrit, ReviewBoard, ... )

### Eventual/Maybe Goals

- Facilitate easy/rich cross-linking to Project Management, Code Review, etc. external systems (configurable/extensible automatic linkification)
- Facilitate rich embed of external else-formatted knowledge: videos, slide decks, tweets, stack overflow questions, etc.
- Provide facilities for navigating and finding what you need in a large corpus of such knowledge
- Provide facilities for asynchronous critique and improvement of documentation (e.g. "Google Doc-style comments", proposed changes)
- Real-time collaboration

### Non-goals:

- Be a Blog platform or CMS (Prefer: [https://www.netlifycms.org/](https://www.netlifycms.org/) )
- Be a full-fledged/full-lifecycle project management system (Prefer: [https://basecamp.com/](https://basecamp.com/); [https://www.notion.so/](https://www.notion.so/);  )

## Why? (and the name)

About 4 years ago, my worldview was impacted by Andrew Clay Shafer's (aka [@littleidea](https://twitter.com/littleidea)) 2013 Velocity talk "there is no talent shortage":

It's a little meandering; I'd still encourage you to watch it if you have the time. My TL;DW is thus:

- "Culture", linguistically, is a system for cultivating (people, ideas, products)
- The market in "knowledge work" is a competition of cultures, largely in incentives: what people are enabled to and rewarded for focus(ing) on
- What enables a team in this market to outcompete (individuals and) other teams is the creation of a culture which is better than competitors at continuously (generating, capturing, sharing, and remembering) learning(s)
- (This is the same essential insight as/of "Lean" in both its Ohno manufacturing and Reis "Startup" incarnations. See also Senge, Marsick & Watkins, Womack, lean.org, Mike Rother, more)
- "You are either building a learning organization or you will be losing to someone who is"
- (It turns out that in addition to being a path to "winning", a collaborative Learning Culture is also a path to happy, fulfilled employees)

Along the way he touches on the idea of Marsick & Watkins's (DLOQ) dimension of "embedded system": "

> Necessary systems to share learning are created, maintained,
and integrated with work; employees have access to these
high- and low-technology systems

By no means is this (even close to) the most important of those dimensions, but I have a vague belief that it can help trojan-horse in the others. In short, it is my hypothesis that if you make it easy enough you can trick a product-development culture into viewing internal docs (secretly: the knowledge they contain) as another product or even *the* ***real*** *product* of a SaaS team. ("Documentation driven development")

Eventually you reach the ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„ of "The real [Your Company/Product Here] was the ~~friends~~ knowledge we  ~~made~~ learned along the way" (learning together is  also an okay way to make friends; This is *mostly* not an anti-capitalist plot). 

### The name

If you watch the talk above (or look at [the slides](https://www.slideshare.net/littleidea/there-is-no-talent-shortage-velocity-2013)) there is a recurrent image: a vintage photograph of the testing of an early [Gatling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_gun)-type cannon:

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/13035641@N00/270353459" title="Early Gatling gun"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/118/270353459_a87b601981.jpg" width="500" height="338" alt="Early Gatling gun"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The metaphor is a little violent for my taste, but it gets the point across: a game-changing tool for "competitive advantage". 

I would aspire for this software to be one as well.
